# GuessingGameDK

Task:
 The challenge is as follows:

    Write a simple game, ideally in C#.NET (or any other language).
    Simple console application (or it can be a Windows Forms application or a Web Application, though these are likely to take longer)
    Ask the user to think of a number between: 1 and 10,000.
    It should then: 
        Guess a number, 
        Then present the user with three options: [1] too low, [2] too high, or [3] correct
        Continues guessing until the game guesses the player's number correctly. 
        Assume the player does NOT cheat.
    Bonus, if completed, then extend the game to offer two modes of play [1] the above, where the game guesses the player's number, and [2] where the player guesses the computer's number. 
    In this second mode, once started: 
        The computer will generate a random number (and keep it secret), 
        Let the player enter a guess. 
        It will respond to the player with one of the of the following: too low, too high, correct.
        It will repeat until the user has successfully guessed the computer's number


Key topics tested in this are: general approach to programming & code quality (code comments, variable names, indentation, consistency etc); iterative logic; Boolean logic; input validation; binary searching.
